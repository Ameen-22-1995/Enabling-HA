1. Go to the HDFS service.

2. Select Actions > Enable High Availability. A screen showing the hosts that are
eligible to run a standby NameNode and the JournalNodes displays.

3. Specify a name for the nameservice or accept the default
name nameservice1 and click Continue.

4. In the NameNode Hosts field, click Select a host. The host selection dialog box
displays. You can select SNN as it will no longer be in use after enabling HA 

5. In the JournalNode Hosts field, click Select hosts. The host selection dialog
box displays. JournalNode is master so we have to select master hosts.

6. Check the checkboxes next to an odd number of hosts (a minimum of three)
to act as JournalNodes and click OK. JournalNodes should be hosted on hosts
with similar hardware specification as the NameNodes. Cloudera recommends
that you put a JournalNode each on the same hosts as the active and standby
NameNodes, and the third JournalNode on similar hardware, such as the
JobTracker.

7. Click Continue.

8. In the JournalNode Edits Directory property, enter a directory location for the
JournalNode edits directory into the fields for each JournalNode host. You
may enter only one directory for each JournalNode. The paths do not need to
be the same on every JournalNode. The directories you specify should be
empty, and must have the appropriate permissions. /jn directory name. we have to make sure that the directory is empty if similar name is there.

9. Click Continue.

10.Cloudera Manager executes a set of commands that will stop the dependent
services, delete, create, and configure roles and directories as appropriate, 
create a nameservice and failover controller, and restart the dependent
services and deploy the new client configuration.


Now we have to configure the dependent services to work with HA
 
First service is Hue, it connects to Web UI

now we have to start another service called HttpFS
hue will connect to HttpFS and HttpFS will connect to Nameservice.

Configuring Hue to Work with HDFS HA

1. Add the HttpFS role.
a. Go to the HDFS service.
b. Click the Instances tab.
c. Click Add Role Instances.
d. Click the text box below the HttpFS field. The Select Hosts dialog box
displays.
e. Select the host on which to run the role and click OK. Any NN
f. Click Continue.
g. Check the checkbox next to the HttpFS role and select Actions for
Selected > Start.

2. After the command has completed, go to the Hue service.
3. Click the Configuration tab.
4. Locate the HDFS Web Interface Role property or search for it by typing its
name in the Search box.
5. Select the HttpFS role you just created instead of the NameNode role, and
save your changes.
6. Restart the Hue service.

Upgrading the Hive Metastore to Use HDFS HA

1. Go the Hive service.

2. Select Actions > Stop.
Note: You may want to stop the Hue, oozie and Hive on Tez services first, if
present, as they depend on the Hive service. Click Stop to confirm the
command.

3. Back up the Hive metastore database.

4. Select Actions > Update Hive Metastore NameNodes and confirm the
command.

Enabling Hive Metastore High
Availability

1. Go to the Hive service.

2. If you have a secure cluster, enable the Hive token store. Non-secure clusters
can skip this step. If more than one role group applies to this configuration,
edit the value for the appropriate role group.
a. Click the Configuration tab.
b. Select Scope > Hive Metastore Server.
c. Select Category > Advanced.
d. Locate the Hive Metastore Delegation Token Store property or search
for it by typing its name In the Search box.
e. Select org.apache.hadoop.hive.thrift.DBTokenStore.
f. Click Save Changes to commit the changes.

3. Click the Instances tab.

4. Click Add Role Instances.

5. Click the text field under Hive Metastore Server.

6. Check the box by the host on which to run the additional metastore and
click OK.

7. Click Continue and click Finish.

8. Check the box by the new Hive Metastore Server role.

9. Select Actions for Selected > Start, and click Start to confirm.

10.Click Close and click to display the stale configurations page.

11.Click Restart Stale Services and click Restart Now.

12.Click Finish after the cluster finishes restarting.


Enabling Resource
Manager HA

1. Go to the YARN service.

2. Select Actions > Enable High Availability. A screen showing the hosts that are
eligible to run a standby ResourceManager displays.

3. Select the host where you want the standby ResourceManager to be installed,
and click Continue.

ResourceManager HA doesn't affect the JobHistory Server (JHS). JHS doesn't
maintain any state, so if the host fails you can simply assign it to a new host. You
can also enable process auto-restart by doing the following:

1. Go to the YARN service.

2. Click the Configuration tab.

3. Select Scope > JobHistory Server.

4. Select Category > Advanced.

5. Locate the Automatically Restart Process property or search for it by typing its
name in the Search box.

6. Click Edit Individual Values

7. Select the JobHistory Server Default Group.

8. Goto Instances > JobHistory Server > Restart the JobHistory Server role.

5. Select Actions > Start.

6. Restart the Hue, oozie and Hive on Tez services if you stopped them prior to
updating the metastore.
